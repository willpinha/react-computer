*üñ•Ô∏è A huge collection of React components using Mantine*

</div>

## ‚ö° About React Computer

React Computer is a huge collection of components made with React so you can be inspired by your user interface creations. It contains components grouped by categories

This project was born with a single objective, which is to be the biggest collection of React components. To achieve this goal, it is open to contributions from any developer in the world. I believe every React developer has something unique to add to this project

## ‚ö° About Mantine

Under the hood, React Computer uses Mantine to create its components. This choice was made because I consider Mantine to be the most complete and batteries-included component library for React

Note that you do not need to use Mantine in your applications to benefit from React Computer. This project can and should be used as a source of inspiration for design and features

## ‚ö° Getting started

### Installing the dependencies

If you want to use React Computer code directly in your applications, you need to install both Mantine and Tabler Icons

- [Install Mantine](https://mantine.dev/getting-started)
- [Install Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/docs/icons/libraries/react)

In addition to these mandatory dependencies, some components may also contain extra dependencies that must also be installed to use it

In some cases, it is also necessary to install Mantine packages in addition to the core and add their respective CSS files to your project

### Using components

If you are using Mantine, you can copy and paste the component code into your own project

React Computer is [MIT license](LICENSE) and will remain free forever

## ‚ö° Contributing

Contributions are open and welcome for all React developers in the world! Thank you very much for making this project what it is today

See the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to create your own components or report bugs
