*üñ•Ô∏è A huge collection of React components using Mantine*

</div>

## About React Computer

React Computer is a huge collection of components made with React so you can be inspired by your user interface creations. It contains components grouped by categories

This project was born with a single objective, which is to be the biggest collection of React components. To achieve this goal, it is open to contributions from any developer in the world. I believe every React developer has something unique to add to this project

## About Mantine

Under the hood, React Computer uses Mantine to create its components. This choice was made because I consider Mantine to be the most complete and batteries-included component library for React

Note that you do not need to use Mantine in your applications to benefit from React Computer. This project can and should be used as a source of inspiration for design and features

## Getting started

### Installing the dependencies

If you want to use React Computer code directly in your applications, you need to install both Mantine and Tabler Icons

- [Install Mantine](https://mantine.dev/getting-started)
- [Install Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/docs/icons/libraries/react)

In addition to these mandatory dependencies, some categories may also contain extra dependencies that must also be installed to use the components in that category. These extra dependencies are shown on the category pages

### Understanding timestamps

A timestamp is a unique identifier for a component in React Computer. Timestamps are automatically generated and contain the format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`, representing the component creation time in UTC

You can search for components using their timestamps. They are also used to manage your starred components and identify components when reporting bugs

## Contributing

Contributions are open and welcome for all React developers in the world! Thank you very much for making this project what it is today

See the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to create your own components or report bugs

## License

This project uses the [MIT license](LICENSE)
